Enable email fetching and ticket replies using SMTP/IMAP settings. osTicket will send notifications to both agents and end users.

‚úÖ Summary
This project helps establish a fully functional osTicket support desk by covering:

Initial system tuning

Organizational structure setup (Departments, Teams)

Email communication integration

Real-world test of ticket lifecycle

These foundational steps are essential before deploying osTicket in a production environment.
